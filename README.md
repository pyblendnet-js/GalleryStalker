# Gallery Stalker V0.3
A web and mobile Intel XDK app for gallery evaluation.
## Introduction
This app shows a background image over which lines can be drawn to indicate the tracks made by visitors in an exhibition.
With enough of these tracks, an indication of which exhibits are popular and how visitor traffic naturally flows can be determined.
## Installation
As a web app, open the index.html with either firefox or chrome browsers.  The web app is only partially functional on IE.
As a mobile app, these files and directories would be placed in the www directory of an Intel XDK project and the cordova File and FullScreen plubins added.
## Licence
See the attached MIT licence.  Please respect visitor privacy when tracking.
